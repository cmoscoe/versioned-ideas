# Living Media and Version Controlled Ideas
version 0.0.1

Most things change. Species, societies, cultures, languages, and people grow and evolve over time into newer, hopefully better, versions of what came before. Media, though, is strangely static. A book, article, song, or film is considered 'done' at the moment it's published or released. This model, where a creative work doesn't change after its initial released, is a legacy of the pre-digital world, and it's holding us back. Content should evolve over time, since ideas need room to evolve as new evidence is accumulated and circumstances change. 

The old model of static, never-chaning creative content made sense for a few thousand years. When ideas were captured on stone, papayrus, paper, vinyl, tape, or film, updating a work was a labour intensive process. When you throw in the overhead of editing and distribution, it was expensive to update and re-release media. It made sense to stick with the published version, and only release a new edition, remix, or director's cut when there was a good reason to put in the time and effort to do so. Most of these legacy restrictions have crumbled in our new digital age, where media can be updated and distributed almost immidiatly at no cost. 

### Modern Software is Living, Evolving Media
Software used to follow a simmilar model to other media, since it faced the same publishing and distribution constraints. When an app or video game needed to be put on a disk, and installed on a computer that wasn't connected to the internet, all the same rules that a book published needed to follow applied. 

Along came the internet. With a connected computer, software could be patched and upgraded without having to create and distribute a physical thing. The effects of this change on how software is built and maintained have been profound. Back when software had to follow the 'old rules', apps were released in 'editions' (think Windows 98), and new versions were purchased and installed on a maybe-annual cycle. With modern, internet powered apps and update systems, software can now be updated in near-real time. At my current company we release multiple new versions of our app every day, and the changes take effect for our users immidiatly. We can respond to feedback, improve the experience, and continually evolve the software to best serve the needs of our users.

These capabilities have also changed how we in the software world think about publishing. Mantras like Y Combinator's "ship early, ship often", Facebook's "move fast and break things" and Reed Hasting's "if you're not embarrased by the first version of your product, you've launched too late" permiate Sillicon Valley thinking and broader tech circles. When you can fix problems or make improvements almost immidiatly and for limited cost, it makes sense to put your work out in the world and evolve it in response to feedback. This change might be most visible in video games, which have evolved from static media that are released once to experiences that are constantly updated to keep the experience fresh and players engaged (while also generating plenty of complaints about buggy experiences at launch).

### Can the living media model work for other stuff?

I don't see why it can't. Most non-software media still follows the traditional publishing model. A book, or even an article, rarely changes once published. This article, however, will evolve. It will respond to feedback and grow into a better version of itself over time. 

Whenever you're reading this, you will be able to see the current version of the article. The version format is borrowed from sotware, and is made up of three numbers divided by dots (v1.0.0, for example). Whenever the article is updated, the numbers will change to reflect the update.

The first number represents the biggest changes, like a change in the thesis or theme of the article. Version 1 will be the first published version, and if the message changes, it will be updated to v2.  

The second number represents a change in evidence, sources, or argument, like a new supporting paragraph being added, or a weak section being eliminated. These changes will affect the second number: v1.1, v1.2, etc.  

The third number represents changes in rhetoric, style, tone, or grammar. These changes don't affect the theme or evidence, but change the delivery. If I need to fix a typo or a bad joke, the third number will update to v1.1.2, v1.1,3, etc.

There is one extra ingredient from the software world that I'll borrow to make this happen: Version Control.

### Embracing change with version control



A record should be kept of all version of a work, both for historical purposes and to let users experience different versions of the work.




Changing your mind is... uncomfortable. When confronted with new evidence or a contrary opinion, our first reaction is a nearly-reflexive rebuttal.
